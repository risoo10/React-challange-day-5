# Personal REACT Challenge (Day 5) - Great Quotes App (React + Firebase)

## Personal challenge
I commited myself to get better with React and started 
this challange to create **one simple react app** every 
single day for the next 7 days. 

I was only a beginner at the beginning, I read few tutorials
on the web, but I wanted to know how I can fully work with 
React. So I started this challenge.

I expect to get real know-how of React and start thinking
in "Component-State-Props" philosophy. 

My challange consisted of:
- HTML Markup
- CSS styling with Styled Components
- REACT interactions, components, states
- Firebase realtime database integration

## Firebase
For this challange I decided to use firebase realtime database and hosting to create real and working public app so data is always saved in the database.
